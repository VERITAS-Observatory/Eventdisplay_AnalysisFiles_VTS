# Support files for dispBDT angular reconstruction

dispBDT files are provided in three different bins of zenith angle:
- small (<40 deg): use dispBDT files trained for 20 deg zenith angle
- medium (40 deg < ze < 50deg): use dispBDT files trained for 50 deg zenith angle
- large (>50deg): use dispBDT files trained for 60 deg zenith angle

Note that this is encoded both in the script `copy_dispBDTs.sh` as in the
analysis steering scripts for MSCW.
