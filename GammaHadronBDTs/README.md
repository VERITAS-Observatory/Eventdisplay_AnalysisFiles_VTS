# BDTs for gamma/hadron separation

This directory contains the TMVA BDT files to calculate the BDT-score to be used for gamma/hadron separation.

BDTs are trained per minor epoch and provided as XML files for each cut in the corresponding directories.

To copy the results files during IRF preparation, use the scripts in this directory (note the hardwired values).
