=======================

syntax:

<telescope ID> <high/low gain> <variable> <min> <max>

all line without '*' in the beginning are ignored

all operators are '>' or '<' 

telescope ID starts at 1 (1 = Telescope 1, 2 = Telescope 2, ..., -1 = all telescopes)

HIGH GAIN CHANNELS

allowed pedestal range 
* -1 HIGHGAIN PEDESTAL           5.0    40.
allowed pedestal variation range (absolute value, this depends on the summation window)
* -1 HIGHGAIN PEDESTALVARIATION  0.5     5.e3
allowed pedestal variation range in standard deviation from the mean value for a particular telescope
* -1 HIGHGAIN PEDESTALDEVIATION  4.      7.
allowed gain range (from laser file)
* -1 HIGHGAIN GAIN               0.5   2.0
allowed range in gain variation (rms of the gain distribution)  (from laser file)
* -1 HIGHGAIN GAINVARIATION      1.e-2  20.e5
maximum value allowed for gain/gainvar (min value is ignored) (from laser file)
* -1 HIGHGAIN GAINDEVIATION     -1.e2    2.0
allow range of time offsets (from laser file)
* -1 HIGHGAIN TIMEOFFSET         0.     20.

LOW GAIN CHANNELS

low gain gain multiplier (deviation in RMS from mean)
* -1 LOWGAIN GAINMULTIPLIER     3.      3.

* -1 LOWGAIN PEDESTAL           0.1    50.
* -1 LOWGAIN PEDESTALVARIATION  0.1     5.e3
* -1 LOWGAIN PEDESTALDEVIATION  3.      5.
* -1 LOWGAIN GAIN               0.625   1.6
* -1 LOWGAIN GAINVARIATION      1.e-2  20.e5
* -1 LOWGAIN GAINDEVIATION     -1.e2    2.0
* -1 LOWGAIN TIMEOFFSET         0.     20.
